# fantasy-names-generator
Fantasy Names Generator is a website that allows users to generate names based on language patterns.
The general idea is to generate names based on a certain learnable patterns in a set of names.  

The website currently has these pretrained models that can be used to generate names:
* American
* French
* German

There are two ways to create a model:
* The first option is to run the manual_model_builder.py file, using a text file listing names.  
* The second option is to use the website feature "Input Your Own Names".

The language patterns are learned by an LSTM-based model.
